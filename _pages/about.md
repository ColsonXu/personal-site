## Motivation
I can still remember that hot summer day when my uncle brought a retired Celeron PC to my home. I was only three years old back then. For the first time I had a gateway to connect to the virtual world. Although I did not know what I was doing, that magical experience surely had changed my life forever. [Talk about how I would read books about operating system design with my camera.]
