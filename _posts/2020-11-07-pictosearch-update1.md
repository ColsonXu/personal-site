It has been a while now since I posted anything here. Schoolwork took up most of my time, and now I am finally ready to document my progress on PictoSearch!

Surprisingly, what took me the longest is not the development itself, rather the intimidating process to get an app up on AppStore. I had to design the icon and screenshots for the AppStore page and deal with the weird troubles that follow. That ended up taking the longest time, and I am still working on it.

As to the app itself, since this is my first time developing any kind of app, I spent a lot of time looking over the Swift (Apple's language for app development) documentation and Apple's resources for making an app. I followed some tutorials and case studies, which has been tremendously helpful. In fact, the finished app is based on the code of a tutorial.

The original app was written by Apple, and its functionality was to recognize phone numbers from business cards. I saw the similarities between the two apps and decided to use this app's codebase as a starter instead of wasting time writing everything from scratch. This way, I get to learn more about how Apple's app work by customizing it.
